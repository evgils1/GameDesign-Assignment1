# GameDesign-Assignment1
Obstacle info:

need to make the following tags for the scripts to work (case sensitive)
- Blackhole for the Blackhole object
- GoldCoin for the gold coin
- SilverCoin for the silver coin (this needs to be changed in the code if no time CopperCoin is in the code)
- Gem for all the gems
- Blackhole for blackhole
- Laser for laser
- Goat for the normal goat
- GoldenGoat for the golden one
- Rock for rocks
- Player on the player

Animation script goes on all collision objects (if you want) the specific settings for each are set in the scene i sent but feel free to change
- Spawner script needs to be adjusted to how the world is set out, change the ranges for where youâ€™d like the them to spawn
    - while loop in spawner is attached to Z bc that is forward in my scene, change for the scene its to make sure no obstacles spawn behind player
 
All other scripts go to the player (minus GoatMovement)
